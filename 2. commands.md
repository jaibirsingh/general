4. what different paths would be denoted by ~ and /
Ans: In Unix-like operating systems, the "~" and "/" symbols represent different directory paths:

**"~" (Tilde):**

* The tilde (~) represents the home directory of the currently logged-in user. It is a shorthand notation to refer to your own user directory.
* For example, if your username is "john," then "~" would represent "/home/john" or "/Users/john," depending on the Unix-like system you are using (Linux, macOS, etc.).

**"/" (Forward Slash):**

* The forward slash (/) represents the root directory of the file system. It is the highest-level directory in Unix-like systems and contains all other directories and files.
* All directory paths in Unix-like systems start with "/" as the root directory.
* For example, "/usr/bin" represents the "bin" directory located within the "usr" directory, which is itself located at the root of the file system.

**In summary, "~" represents the home directory of the current user, while "/" represents the root directory of the entire file system. These symbols are used to specify directory paths in Unix-like commands and scripts.**
