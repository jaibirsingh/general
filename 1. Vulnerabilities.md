### Description
* Vulnerability in the MySQL Server product of Oracle MySQL (component: InnoDB).
* Supported versions that are affected are 5.7.37 and prior and 8.0.28 and prior.
* Easily exploitable vulnerability allows a high privileged attacker with network access via multiple protocols to compromise MySQL Server.
* Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized ability to cause a hang or frequently repeatable crash (complete DOS) of MySQL Server.
* CVSS 3.1 Base Score 4.9 (Availability impacts). CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H).

OPENSSL THE C_REHASH SCRIPT ALLOWS COMMAND INJECTION (CVE-2022-2068)


### Description
In addition to the c_rehash shell command injection identified in CVE-2022-1292, further circumstances where the c_rehash script does not properly sanitise shell metacharacters to prevent command injection were found by code review. When the CVE-2022-1292 was fixed, it was not discovered that there were other places in the script where the file names of certificates being hashed were possibly passed to a command executed through the shell. This script is distributed by some operating systems in a manner where it is automatically executed. On such operating systems, an attacker could execute arbitrary commands with the privileges of the script. Use of the c_rehash script is considered obsolete and should be replaced by the OpenSSL rehash command line tool. Fixed in OpenSSL 3.0.4 (Affected 3.0.0,3.0.1,3.0.2,3.0.3). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1p (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1o). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2zf (Affected 1.0.2-1.0.2ze).


### Recommended Solution
* Restrict accessibility of the server only through VPN or internal network.

# Vulnerability 3

APACHE HTTPD: MOD_LUA USE OF UNINITIALIZED VALUE OF IN R:PARSEBODY (CVE-2022-22719)


### Description
A carefully crafted request body can cause a read to a random memory area which could cause the process to crash. This issue affects Apache HTTP Server 2.4.52 and earlier.


### Recommended Solution
Apache HTTPD >= 2.4 and < 2.4.53
Upgrade to Apache HTTPD version 2.4.53
Apache HTTPD version 2.4.53 Download and apply the upgrade from: http://archive.apache.org/dist/httpd/httpd2.4.53.tar.gz
Many platforms and distributions provide pre-built binary packages for Apache HTTP server. These pre-built packages are usually customized and optimized for a particular distribution, therefore we recommend that you use the packages if they are available for your operating system.

# Vulnerability 4

### Requirements
All assets of XYZ Inc. should have the latest Operating System security updates installed.


### Observation
Though most systems had the latest OS security updates, some legacy systems that supported XYZ Inc.â€™s older hardware didnâ€™t have the latest security updates.


### XYZ Inc. Comments
These systems are older and installing security updates on them might break the functionality of these systems.

### Solution
Restrict accessibility of the servers to only required usage

# Vulnerability 5

### Requirements
All network communication, user activity,and security device logs shall be aggregated in a single platform (SIEM) and monitored continuously.


### Observation
XYZ Inc. has some assets in the cloud and others on-prem. It was observed that the cloud assets were not integrated with the SIEM, which is present on-prem.


### XYZ Inc. Comments
The logs from the cloud are not integrated with the SIEM because this will require enabling internet access to the SIEM, which is not desirable.

### Solution
* Aggregate cloud logs in a single place
* Then forward the logs from that place to on-prem network using a restricted tunnel.
